### Step 1) Identify The motherboard and setup that your 3D printer is using

Does your printer have DualZ or BLtouch or 2208/2209 Stepper Drivers? Which Motherboard are you using. You can find it printed directly on the Motherboard (MKS_GEN_L_V1.0) as an example. 

### Step 2) Fork or Download the firmware package that conforms to your printer setup. 

I will do my best to add a working firmware for each board being used. If I miss one please let me know and ill do my best to add it. 

Youll want to download VS Code and Arduino IDE to compile your firmware. 

### Step 3) Download VS Code and Arduino IDE
